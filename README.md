#### Contributions

##### Code

**Bugfixes should be sent to to current stable branch, which is the same as major version number.**
Breaking features and major improvements should be sent into `master`. When you send PRs to master, they will be added to release cycle only when the next stable branch is started.

Check also the "tests/README.md" to learn more about the available internal Codeception tests.

##### Documentation

The documentation for each module is directly generated from the corresponding docblock which can be found in each module (src/Common/*).
